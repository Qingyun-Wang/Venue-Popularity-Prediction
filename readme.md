Our objective is to predict a new venue's popularity from information available when the venue opens.  We will do this by machine learning from a data set of venue popularities provided by Yelp.  The data set contains meta data about the venue (where it is located, the type of food served, etc.).  It also contains a star rating. Note that the venues are not limited to restaurants. This tutorial will walk you through one way to build a machine learning algorithm.
