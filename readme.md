# Venue Popularity Prediction using Ensemble Models

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the popularity of new venues based on information available at the time of their opening. Utilizing a dataset provided by Yelp, which includes metadata about various venues (such as location, type of food served, etc.) and their star ratings, we aim to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques. The model will help anticipate the potential success of new venues across different categories, not limited to restaurants.

## Features
- **Ensemble Modeling**: Developed a robust ensemble model using Scikit-learn to predict venue popularity, leveraging the strengths of multiple predictive models for improved accuracy.
- **Model Integration**: Constructed a comprehensive pipeline that integrates various machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and Random Forest, to utilize their combined predictive power.
- **Data Handling**: Implemented advanced data preprocessing techniques to transform raw data into a format suitable for machine learning and to enhance model performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas - For data manipulation
- NumPy - For numerical operations
